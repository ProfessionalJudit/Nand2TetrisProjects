# Nand2TetrisProjects

This is a collection of the projects described in the book **"The elements in computing systems"**  from the course **"Nand2Tetris"**

As usual, like any code I don't do for work, it's gonna be messy... 
It should be understandable enough, if you've done the course you already know what this is doing, if not, you may need to scratch your head a little, but it's fine, I belive in you :3 

## Project Specific Stuff
### Assembler
To use just compile main.cpp, and pass the route to an asm file as an argument, a file called output.hack will be created with your ✨fancy✨ machine code.
