# Nand2TetrisProjects

This is a collection of the projects described in the book **"The elements in computing systems"**  from the course **"Nand2Tetris"**

As usual, like any code I don't do for work, it's a little bit messy... 
It should be understandable enough, if you've done the course you already know what this does, if not, you may need to scratch your head a little, but it's fine, I belive in you :3 

## Project Specific Stuff
### Assembler
To use just compile main.cpp, and pass the route to a asm file as an argument, a file called output.hack will be created with your ✨fancy✨ machine code.
### Chapter 7 VM
To use just compile main.cpp, and pass the route to a vm file as an argument, since the fully finished code is suposed to be in chapter 8, this doesen't genrate an output file, instead it prints the generated asm to the terminal, it was a little easier to test like this.
